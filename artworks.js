    description: "In <strong> Monkeys Everywhere - The Dance of Instinct </strong> the viewer is drawn into a vivid, almost surreal arboreal world—where chaos and harmony coexist. The fiery orange backdrop, with its swirling patterns of red and ember-like foliage, evokes not just a forest, but the primal energy of life itself. This infernal palette could symbolize the untamed forces of nature or the inner fire of consciousness, both beautiful and relentless. The four monkeys, scattered across the canvas, each embody a different aspect of existence and awareness. One monkey strides purposefully across the top, representing action and progress—the ceaseless march forward. Another sits still, contemplative, perhaps symbolizing awareness, observation, and the fleeting stillness in life’s constant motion. The two monkeys entangled and hanging upside down evoke play, chaos, and interconnection. Their inversion from the norm suggests the unpredictable nature of existence and the duality of experience—joy and struggle, freedom and entrapment. Their mirrored postures also reflect the human tendency to see oneself in others, perhaps a meditation on identity and empathy. Overall, the painting becomes an allegory for the human condition, with the monkeys acting as stand-ins for our own restless minds—forever swinging between past and future, action and reflection, instinct and understanding. Amid the vivid intensity of their world, there’s a quiet message: that even in the wildest of places, meaning can be found—not in stillness, but in movement."

    title: "Chasing Luck",
    year: 2023,
    collection: "Portfolio",
    size_cm: "120 × 90 cm",
    medium: "Oil on canvas",
    status: "Available",
    price: "AED 10,000",
    image: "./images/Chasing-Luck_res.jpg",
    location: "Dubai, UAE",
    description: "<strong> Chasing Luck </strong> captures the perpetual pursuit of fortune. Two dynamically posed bunnies engage in a playful, circular chase within a sunlit meadow. Each bunny mirrors the diverse forms luck can assume, as for each person the concept of luck is different. The meadow's vibrant movement, depicted through chaotic brushstrokes, lends an energetic quality. The interplay of textures and contrasts invites exploration of a timeless pursuit of elusive fortunes."
